These files are HTML documents that are based on the R crosstalk package. Maps are linked with table using shared data.


> library(leaflet)
> library(DT)
> library(crosstalk)
> library(htmlwidgets)

After loading these packages, I put in a placeholder name (“certscsv” in this case) and loaded the file from a csv.

> certscsv <- read.csv("D:/COL_SHEETS/certscsv.csv")

Then I made that data into shared data.

> sharedcsvdata <- SharedData$new(certcsv)

Then I built the map using leaflet and the table using datatable() from DT.

> bscols(
  leaflet(sharedcsvdata) %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(),
  datatable(sharedcsvdata, extensions="Scroller", style="bootstrap", class="compact", width="100%",
 		   options=list(deferRender=TRUE, scrollY=300, scroller=TRUE))
)

I then saved the output as a webpage.Those are on the GitHub under the crosstalk-items.
