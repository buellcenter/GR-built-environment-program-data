Stills of scale/hue comparisons

To make static graphs of specific comparisons, I started from the clean full dataset on GitHub. Then, I portioned the data into CSVs based on the comparison as necessary. Here, the data is split into public and private for analysis.

> publicunis <- read.csv("D:/COL_SHEETS/publicunis.csv")
> privateunis <- read.csv("D:/COL_SHEETS/privateunis.csv")

Then, feed that data into leaflet. Add customization as desired. Some customization options can be found here.

> publicunis %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers()
> privateunis %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers()



Note: To change the name of the first column in imported data, use the following command:

colnames(data_name)[1] <- "new_name"

Make sure it is [1], otherwise youâ€™ll just change the name of the index in the data frame.
