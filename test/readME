This folder is a test for the individual widgets created.

The first is a leaflet map, the second is a reactable table. These were made as inidivual widgets and are not self contained.


> hhh <- leaflet(testing234) %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(label=testing234$university))
> iii <- reactable(testing123, groupBy = “university”, sortable= TRUE, searchable = TRUE, defaultPageSize = 4))

> saveWidget(hhh, file = "map.html", selfcontained = FALSE)
> saveWidget(iii, file = "table.html", selfcontained = FALSE)
